PR,Patch Richness Density,"m = number of patch types (classes) present in the landscape,
excluding the landscape border if present.","PR > 1, without limit","Patch richness is perhaps the simplest measure of landscape composition, but note
that it does not reflect the relative abundances of patch types. Note, this metric is
redundant with both patch richness density and relative patch richness."
PRD,Relative Patch Richness,"PR equals the number of different patch types present within the landscape
boundary divided by total landscape area (m2), multiplied by 10,000 and 100 (to
convert to 100 hectares). Note, total landscape area (A) includes any internal
background present.","PRD > 0, without limit","Patch richness density standardizes richness to a per area basis that facilitates
comparison among landscapes. Note, this metric is redundant with both patch
richness and relative patch richness"
SHDI,Shannon's Diversity Index,"SHDI equals minus the sum, across all patch types, of the proportional abundance
of each patch type multiplied by that proportion. Note, Pi is based on total
landscape area (A) excluding any internal background present.","SHDI > 0, without limit
SHDI = 0 when the landscape contains only 1 patch (i.e., no diversity). SHDI
increases as the number of different patch types (i.e., patch richness, PR) increases
and/or the proportional distribution of area among patch types becomes more
equitable.","Shannon’s diversity index is a popular measure of diversity in community ecology,
applied here to landscapes. Shannon’s index is somewhat more sensitive to rare
patch types than Simpson’s diversity index."
SIDI,Simpson's Diversity Index,"SIDI equals 1 minus the sum, across all patch types, of the proportional
abundance of each patch type squared. Note, Pi is based on total landscape area
(A) excluding any internal background present.","0 <= SIDI < 1
SIDI = 0 when the landscape contains only 1 patch (i.e., no diversity). SIDI
approaches 1 as the number of different patch types (i.e., patch richness, PR)
increases and the proportional distribution of area among patch types becomes
more equitable.","Simpson’s diversity index is another popular diversity measure borrowed from
community ecology. Simpson's index is less sensitive to the presence of rare types
and has an interpretation that is much more intuitive than Shannon's index.
Specifically, the value of Simpson's index represents the probability that any 2
pixels selected at random would be different patch types."
MSIDI,Modified Simpson's Diversity Index,"MSIDI equals minus the logarithm of the sum, across all patch types, of the
proportional abundance of each patch type squared. Note, Pi is based on total
landscape area (A) excluding any internal background present.","MSIDI >= 0, without limit
MSIDI = 0 when the landscape contains only 1 patch (i.e., no diversity). MSIDI
increases as the number of different patch types (i.e., patch richness, PR) increases
and the proportional distribution of area among patch types becomes more
equitable.","Modified Simpson's diversity index eliminates the intuitive interpretation of Simpson's
index as a probability, but transforms the index into one that belongs to a general
class of diversity indices to which Shannon's diversity index belongs."
SHEI,Shannon's Evenness Index,"SHEI equals minus the sum, across all patch types, of the proportional abundance
of each patch type multiplied by that proportion, divided by the logarithm of the
number of patch types. In other words, the observed Shannon's Diversity Index
divided by the maximum Shannon's Diversity Index for that number of patch
types. Note, Pi is based on total landscape area (A) excluding any internal
background present.","0 <= SHEI <= 1
SHDI = 0 when the landscape contains only 1 patch (i.e., no diversity) and
approaches 0 as the distribution of area among the different patch types becomes
increasingly uneven (i.e., dominated by 1 type). SHDI = 1 when distribution of
area among patch types is perfectly even (i.e., proportional abundances are the
same).","Shannon’s evenness index is expressed such that an even distribution of area among
patch types results in maximum evenness. As such, evenness is the complement of
dominance."
SIEI,Simpson's Evenness Index,"SIEI equals 1 minus the sum, across all patch types, of the proportional
abundance of each patch type squared, divided by 1 minus 1 divided by the
number of patch types. In other words, the observed Simpson's Diversity Index
divided by the maximum Simpson's Diversity Index for that number of patch
types. Note, Pi is based on total landscape area (A) excluding any internal
background present","0 <= SIEI <= 1
SIDI = 0 when the landscape contains only 1 patch (i.e., no diversity) and
approaches 0 as the distribution of area among the different patch types becomes
increasingly uneven (i.e., dominated by 1 type). SIDI = 1 when distribution of area
among patch types is perfectly even (i.e., proportional abundances are the same).","Simpson’s evenness index is expressed such that an even distribution of area among
patch types results in maximum evenness. As such, evenness is the complement of
dominance."
MSIEI,Modified Simpson's Evenness Index,"MSIEI equals minus the logarithm of the sum, across all patch types, of the
proportional abundance of each patch type squared, divided by the logarithm of
the number of patch types. In other words, the observed modified Simpson's
diversity index divided by the maximum modified Simpson's diversity index for
that number of patch types. Note, Pi is based on total landscape area (A) excluding
any internal background present.","0 <= MSIEI <= 1
MSIDI = 0 when the landscape contains only 1 patch (i.e., no diversity) and
approaches 0 as the distribution of area among the different patch types becomes
increasingly uneven (i.e., dominated by 1 type). MSIDI = 1 when distribution of
area among patch types is perfectly even (i.e., proportional abundances are the
same)","Modified Simpson’s evenness index is expressed such that an even distribution of area
among patch types results in maximum evenness. As such, evenness is the
complement of dominance."

DIVISION,Landscape Division Index,"DIVISION equals 1 minus the sum of patch area (m2) divided by total landscape
area (m2), quantity squared, summed across all patches of the corresponding patch
type. Note, total landscape area (A) includes any internal background present.","0 <= DIVISION < 1
DIVISION = 0 when the landscape consists of single patch. DIVISION
approaches 1 when the focal patch type consists of single, small patch one cell in
area. As the proportion of the landscape comprised of the focal patch type
decreases and as those patches decrease in size, DIVISION approaches 1.","Division is based on the cumulative patch area distribution and is interpreted as the
probability that two randomly chosen pixels in the landscape are not situated in
the same patch of the corresponding patch type. Note, the similarity with
Simpson’s diversity index, only here the sum is across the proportional area of
each patch in the focal class, rather than the proportional area of each patch ‘type’
in the landscape. Note, DIVISION is redundant with effective mesh size (MESH)
below, i.e., they are perfectly, but inversely, correlated, but both metrics are
included because of differences in units and interpretation. DIVISION is
interpreted as a probability, whereas MESH is given as an area."
SPLIT,Splitting Index,"PLIT equals the total landscape area (m2) squared divided by the sum of patch
area (m2) squared, summed across all patches of the corresponding patch type.
Note, total landscape area (A) includes any internal background present","1 <= SPLIT <= number of cells in the landscape area squared
SPLIT = 1 when the landscape consists of single patch. SPLIT increases as the
focal patch type is increasingly reduced in area and subdivided into smaller
patches. The upper limit of SPLIT is constrained by the ratio of landscape area to
cell size and is achieved when the corresponding patch type consists of a single
one pixel patch.","Split is based on the cumulative patch area distribution and is interpreted as the
effective mesh number, or number of patches with a constant patch size when the
corresponding patch type is subdivided into S patches, where S is the value of the
splitting index."
MESH,Effective Mesh Size,"MESH equals the sum of patch area squared, summed across all patches of the
corresponding patch type, divided by the total landscape area (m2), divided by
10,000 (to convert to hectares). Note, total landscape area (A) includes any
internal background present.","ratio of cell size to landscape area <= MESH <= total landscape area (A)
The lower limit of MESH is constrained by the ratio of cell size to landscape area
and is achieved when the corresponding patch type consists of a single one pixel
patch. MESH is maximum when the landscape consists of a single patch","Mesh is based on the cumulative patch area distribution and is interpreted as the
size of the patches when the corresponding patch type is subdivided into S
patches, where S is the value of the splitting index. Note, MESH is redundant with
DIVISION above, i.e., they are perfectly, but inversely, correlated, but both
metrics are included because of differences in units and interpretation. DIVISION
is interpreted as a probability, whereas MESH is given as an area. In addition, note
the similarity between MESH and area-weight mean patch size (AREA_AM).
Conceptually, these two metrics are closely related, but computationally they are
quite different at the class level. Specifically, AREA_AM gives the area-weight
mean patch size of patches of the corresponding class, where the proportional
area of each patch is based on total class area (i.e., the total area of patches of the
corresponding patch type). MESH, on the other hand, also gives the area
weighted mean patch size of patches of the corresponding patch size, but the
proportional area of each patch is based on the total landscape area, not the class
area. In this way, MESH takes into account the patch size distribution of the
corresponding class as well as the total landscape area comprised of that class.
Thus, holding the patch size distribution (of the corresponding class) constant, as
the landscape extent increases (and the percent of the landscape comprised of this
class decreases), MESH for the corresponding class will decrease. Hence,
AREA_AM provides an absolute measure of patch structure, whereas MESH
provides a relative measure of patch structure."
